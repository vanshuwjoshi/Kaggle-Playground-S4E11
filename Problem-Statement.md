Original data - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumansharmadataworld/depression-surveydataset-for-analysis

This dataset was collected as part of a comprehensive survey aimed at understanding the factors contributing to depression risk among adults.  Participants, ranging from 18 to 60 years old, voluntarily provided inputs on factors such as age, gender, city, degree, job satisfaction, study satisfaction, study/work hours, and family history among others. Participants were asked to provide inputs without requiring any professional mental health assessments or diagnostic test scores.

The target variable, 'Depression', represents whether the individual is at risk of depression, marked as 'Yes' or 'No', based on their responses to lifestyle and demographic factors.

It is a binary classification problem (0: Not depressed, 1: Depressed).
